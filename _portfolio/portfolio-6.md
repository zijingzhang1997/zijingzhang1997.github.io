•	Designed and implemented a testing protocol to perform human study (N=32) on simulated dyspnea (shortness of breath) by the exertion and Borg scales.
•	Implemented algorithms to identify various features embedded in breathing waveforms to predict the dyspnea score in comparison with the self-report scores.
•	Designed an automatic system using machine learning algorithms of decision tree and random forest to evaluate the objective dyspnea score.
