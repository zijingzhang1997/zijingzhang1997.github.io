•	Developed a non-invasive respiration sensor integrated into furniture that can be invisible to the user and enhance comfort and convenience. The sensor was modified from an RF coaxial cable with a designed notch.  
•	Captured the cardiopulmonary waveforms and derived the breath rate and heart rate with variations in positions.  
•	Implemented the sensor to detect simulated respiratory disorders including central and obstructive sleep apnea.  
•	Performed a human study (N=10) that confirmed the validity of the sensing system and signal processing.
