My sensing system can measure physiological signals which can also provide a unique insight into phycological condition. Attention is one of the crucial areas of investigation in phycology. Investigating attention can exert influences in fields ranging from mental health and the study of disorders of consciousness to artificial intelligence and related areas. Our previous research has demonstrated the possibility to assess attention/stress utilizing physiological signals including respiratory and heart rate obtained from our sensors. 

In my future work, I will conduct large-scale human study to  evaluate stress/attention using respiratory and heartbeat characteristics from the NCS sensor. Various attentive task will be included in the human-study protocol. Correlation of reaction times to vital signs will also be  investigated.
This study can be important since emotions are fundamental to human interaction and they influence many aspects of our lives. Our research can help reveal the intrinsic relation between physiological behavior and mental condition and further develop mental intelligence platform.
