**Limitation in Existing systems**:Conventional electromyography (EMG) measures the continuous neural activity during muscle contraction, but lacks explicit quantification of the actual contraction. Mechanomyography (MMG) and accelerometers only measure body surface motion, while ultrasound, CT-scan and MRI are restricted to in-clinic snapshots.

**Novel muscle monitoring**:Here we propose a novel radiomyography (RMG) for continuous muscle actuation sensing that can be wearable and touchless, capturing both superficial and deep muscle groups. We verified RMG experimentally by a forearm wearable sensor for detailed hand gesture recognition.

This study can be important since emotions are fundamental to human interaction and they influence many aspects of our lives. Our research can help reveal the intrinsic relation between physiological behavior and mental condition and further develop mental intelligence platform.
