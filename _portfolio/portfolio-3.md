•	Performed clinical study on 30 patients in Weill sleep center and collected overnight recording data using bed-integrated sensor which is invisible to the user.  
•	Developed machine-learning algorithm that can automatically detect and predict sleep disorder on real patients with high fidelity.  
•	demonstrated the capability to prognosticate sleep apnea around 60 seconds earlier  

In the future of my research in sleep study, my system can hopefully predict the sleep disorder in advance using mature algorithms. Developing a platform that can identify the sleep disorders in advance can be extremely important since episodes of stop breathing during sleep can very dangerous and my system can prevent deterioration of the disease and help early diagnosis and treatment.
