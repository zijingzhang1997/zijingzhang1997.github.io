•	Employed ambient low-cost passive RFID tags for the recognition of 3D shape and geometry of hand gesture and feet. 
•	Our system has demonstrated high accuracy in recognizing different hand gestures and participants precisely. 
•	The equivalent spatial resolution is higher and the 3D geometry is more complex than conventional RFID-based fingerprinting .
