Sensors to Improve Medicine and Machine Intelligence

My present research interests focus on vital signs monitoring, digital health sensing and telemedicine. My current research projects are on Radio Frequency (RF) sensor systems for cardiopulmonary monitoring and imaging for human body, focusing on RF systems, non-invasive biomedical sensors, signal processing and algorithms, machine learning and artificial intelligence.  

Non-invasive sensing of physiological signals including respiratory rate, respiratory volume, and heart rate with high user comfort is of great significance for health diagnostic systems. My research seeks non-contact and continuous measuring system utilizing RF sensors that can be invisible to the user and greatly enhance comfort and convenience to facilitate many healthcare applications. I have a strong faith that my research can ultimately transform how healthcare is experienced and delivered and provide highly personalized and precisely targeted diagnostics and therapeutics to people.
